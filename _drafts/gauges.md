title: Easy Website Analytics with Gauges
tags: analytics gauges google
---

I've been using [Gauges](http://get.gaug.es) for quite a while now and so far I'm a pretty happy customer. It does exactly what it says---website analytics you can actually understand.

Gauges has been started

I'm not a power user when it comes to web analytics, so feature-wise I'm not sure how it competes with other analytics services, but the interface is really simple and it's very quick to set up. I like to be able to quickly find basic information. Every time I tried Google Analytics, I ran away screaming because the interface is simply terrifying. I can't find anything and it leaves me curled up in the fetal position and shaking. I'm sure there is some smarter CLI way to use it, but I don't feel like going through that trouble. Sorry, Google, but that thing desperately needs a redesign.

## Strengths

However, unlike Google Analytics, Gauges is a paid service, but it's worth it. I can find out all the essential info about my web traffic very quickly, like:

  - What is the most popular page on my site?
  - How many views did my site get today?
  - Which browsers did the visitors use?

And much more.

## Weaknesses

The mobile app could use some work, it's a bit outdated and is missing a lot of functionality.
