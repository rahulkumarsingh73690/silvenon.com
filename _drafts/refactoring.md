If you're going to be maintaining a React app, you'll often refactor your app to implement new libraries and best practices that you learned about. Refactoring by hand is boring and error-prone, and simple search & replace only gets you so far. JSCodeShift is a tool you should learn how to use, it will save you time and bring you happiness. You shouldn't have to deal with crappy code just because you don't have time to refactor it.
