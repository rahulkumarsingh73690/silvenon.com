      description: A choir website that I volunteered to build. It's a static site generated with Ruby. It was quite an advanced project for me because it's a first responsive site I made (you can resize the browser to see how the site adapts). It was a challenge for me because it's a pretty image-heavy site and images are known to be the hardest part of responsive web design.

      description: When I started getting into task runners like Grunt and gulp.js, I was using Yeoman generators a lot. As I was learning I was also contributing to these generators as well, and was eventually added to the Yeoman team, so I started maintaining their generators.

      description: When learning how to do simple animations in React like fading in and out, React Transition Group was the most popular library for doing this, but it took me a while to fully understand it. My contribution started with writing a blog post [The Nuances of React Transition Group](/blog/the-nuances-of-react-transition-group), soon afterwards I started contributing to the library itself with the emphasis on trying to make the usage as clear as possible in the documentation.

      description: I worked as a junior frontend developer in a local team of designers and an iOS developer. This is a job where I learned a ton about frontend in a very little time because I was the only frontend developer. It was an amazing experience, I'm very thankful that I got to work with such skilled designers and developers.

      duration: 10 months
      description: I worked in a remote team on the frontend of a Phoenix project. I enhanced the stack with some modern frontend practices and learned a lot about peer reviews and end-to-end testing. I really enjoyed working at a company that takes such good care of their employees.

    - name: Reactor Studio
      duration: 3 years and 2 months
      description: While working with this client I discovered the role of frontend platform developer, which focuses on improving developer rather than user experience. This role suited me perfectly and it was an excellent learning experience, before working with this client I've only ever seen this kind of tasks being put off as low priority.
