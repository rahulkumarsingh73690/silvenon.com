Since this blog post was getting long, I decided to split it into two separate posts:

<ol>
  <li>
    <Link to="/blog/mocking-functions-with-jest">
      Mocking with Jest: Spying on Functions and Changing their Implementation
    </Link>
  </li>
  <li>
    <Link to="/blog/mocking-modules-with-jest">
      Mocking with Jest: Taking Advantage of the Module System
    </Link>
  </li>
</ol>
