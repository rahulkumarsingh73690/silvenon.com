During the majority of my adult life I've been meeting and dating women from my social circles. After some experience I realized that in those relationships I was always feeling some kind of pressure to be fine and for our relationship to be successful. But that's not how it works, every relationship fails until one doesn't.

I started wanting to have romantic relationships with women I don't share friends with. Joining a team like volunteering, choir etc. wasn't an option because there I would also eventually be "doing" that relationship in front of everyone. No, I wanted to meet a woman out of the blue.

But that's hard, it often requires a single interaction to go so smoothly that she agrees to go on a date. Some men are excellent at this, I'm not. I basically have to pretend like things will go well, i.e. "fake it till you make it". In addition to that, I started exposing myself to a lot of feminist content, which was often about how men who hit on women are obnoxious. I love feminism, it made me more aware of sexism in the world and made me a better man, but it also lowered my self-esteem.

The fact that I'm polyamorous really narrowed down my dating pool, it's not a very popular relationship type in my conservative country. I was looking for an alternative method of meeting women, so I was really happy when I discovered dating apps! I've been using them quite a lot over the past few years. They eliminate a lot of unnecessary obstacles, for example I can be pretty sure that women there are actually looking for someone. Also, consequences of rejection are minimal, most of the times I just don't get a reply and that's fine.

I've tried most of the popular dating apps:

  - OkCupid
  - Tinder
  - Bumble
  - Badoo

## OkCupid

OkCupid has many interesting features and algorithms to help you find a good partner. The more work you put into your profile, the better your chances are to find a great partner. When you're browsing through potential matches, you get to see an actual percentage of how well you two might get along, how awesome is that?! OkCupid has so many ways to express yourself, which is great for conversation, you can always check out their profile and find new topics to keep the conversation going.

On OkCupid I immediately found a great girlfriend. Not only is she still my favorite person, I also strongly believe that the fact that we didn't share any common friends had a lot to do with the success of our relationship.

## Tinder

Later I started exploring other apps, Tinder is an extremely popular choice because of its simplicity, which seems to be considered a feature! Just spend a couple of minutes on the setup and start swiping. If both of you swipe right, you can talk to each other, easy-peasy.

But this kind of experience encourages you to stop reading their descriptions and focus just on photos. Sure, photos can sometimes tell quite a story, but most of it is probably just your imagination because you're looking for some action. You're rounding these people up to someone you might maybe possibly eventually like. When someone comes up for swiping, all you know is that that person didn't swipe you left, you don't know if they swiped right or at all. On OkCupid you can find out _so much_ about someone before sending them a message, so that message can be so much more than "u up?". On Tinder I usually have to seriously amp up my imagination and catch some wave of inspiration, while trying to sound confident. Sounds familiar? Yep, back to hitting on women based on no information.

Many people complain about their Tinder experiences. They go out, realize that the person is a bad match and go home trying to convince themselves that they didn't throw away their precious free time. But you can't expect more from applications like Tinder, they are pretty superficial and risky. Not to say that beautiful and deep relationships can't come out of it, just that the number of bad dates will probably be higher.

## Bumble

Bumble and Badoo are basically variations of Tinder. Bumble has an interesting twist where only women are allowed to send the first message. Every dating app has some sort of mechanism for dealing with shitty men who send dick pics and say nasty things to women. OkCupid started giving men only one chance to make a first impression, if they don't answer you can't send more messages, which should motivate men to try harder to make a better impression, which is a pretty cool idea.

## Badoo

Badoo... well, Badoo is a mess. It's mostly like Tinder, but also has other half-baked weirdness. You can send women "presents", and to this day I don't know what that is because they don't tell you that until you press the button "Send a gift". I'll never ever press that button, so I consider that a broken feature because it has a serious usability problem. What is more, you can't reorder profile photos, when you login with Facebook it pulls **all** photos of you (not just profile photos).

  - I like simplicity, I build web applications after all, but simplicity has to make sense. OkCupid has **lots** of ways to express yourself, not only with photos and text, but also answering their questions, which is one of the important criteria that OkCupid uses to match you with other people. This doesn't make OkCupid complicated because none of this stuff is required, you're just more likely to find someone if you put more effort. Humans aren't numbers, you can't calculate who would be a good fit for you, so the more info you have, the likelier you are to make better decisions.
