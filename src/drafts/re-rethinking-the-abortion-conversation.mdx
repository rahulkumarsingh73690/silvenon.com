I came across an interesting Twitter thread by Gabrielle Blair where she suggests rethinking the conversation about abortion. There are three versions of the same content, pick the one which suits you best:

  - [Twitter thread][format-thread]
  - [Twitter moment][format-moment]
  - [blog post][format-post]

I feel like there's more to unpack here, so I decided to write a blog post instead of losing myself in Twitter replies. Let's start, tweet by tweet (I'll skip some of them):

  > "If you want to stop abortion, you need to prevent unwanted pregnancies. And men are 100% responsible for unwanted pregnancies. No for real, they are. Perhaps you are thinking: IT TAKES TWO! And yes, it does take two for **intentional** pregnancies."

I absolutely agree that preventing unwanted pregnancies is what everyone should be focusing on. I'll never understand people who oppose abortions and I will just assume that I don't have to explain why.

She correctly guessed that I thought it takes two for any kind of pregnancy, wanted or unwanted. But she continues to unpack why it's different for unwanted pregnancies.

  > "And though their sperm gets crappier as they age, men can cause unwanted pregnancies from puberty till death. So just starting with basic biology + the calendar it’s easy to see men are the issue here."

True, men can cause more pregnancies than women because men aren't the ones getting pregnant. Did I understand the point correctly?

  > "There’s a lot to be unpacked just in that story, but I’ll simply point out (in case you didn’t know) that as a society, we really don’t mind if women suffer, physically or mentally, as long as it makes things easier for men."

Is that the only possible conclusion?
